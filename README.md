Project Title: Comparative Analysis of Fruit & Vegetable Pricing Across Canadian Loblaws Stores
This comprehensive project has been meticulously carried out by a dedicated team of data analysts: Pradiban Anthony, Mahreen Ayaz, Mike Banister, Christopher Chen, and Brandon Liu.

Project Description
Our objective was to investigate the variations in pricing for fruits and vegetables across Loblaws grocery stores, a prominent Canadian supermarket chain. We sought to discern whether geographical location influenced the cost of produce, focusing on four distinct Canadian cities: Ottawa, Edmonton, Toronto, and Vancouver.

Methodology
We started by strategically selecting four representative Loblaws stores from these cities. The requisite information on the fruit and vegetable products was obtained through a carefully executed web scraping process. The extracted data was subsequently organized and transformed into a universally readable CSV file. This formatted data file was then interfaced with our custom-built Flask application to carry out further analysis.

Implementation & Visualization
To display the results of our in-depth analysis, we engineered a user-friendly website. This involved the integration of our Flask application with a HTML file, a JavaScript file, and a CSS file.

We have incorporated an intuitive user interface in the form of a drop-down menu listing all the fruits and vegetables offered by the four selected stores. To provide a comprehensive understanding of the pricing differences, each product in the list is accompanied by two dynamic visualizations:

A comparative chart showing the price variations of a selected product among the four stores.
A geographical map exhibiting a bubble chart that represents the highest and lowest pricing cities for that product.
The cities with the highest prices are marked with a distinct red bubble, while the cities with the most affordable prices are highlighted with a green bubble.

This project allows for an easy comparison of fruit and vegetable prices across different geographical locations, thus offering invaluable insights to both consumers and businesses alike.

P.S. A SQL database was developed, however due to technical problems we ended up deciding to bypass using it for our flask app development. The file SQL contains our work regarding SQL.
